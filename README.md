#Cycle Hire Map (JS playground)#

==========

Nominally a map of cycle hire docks in London, but really just a way for me to play around with JS.

**Not production ready.** Uses _Promises_, so requires a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari 8+).

Uses static data source to avoid hitting call limit, but you can use a proxy to get live data. Huge thanks to the people at [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) for making such a simple map API.
